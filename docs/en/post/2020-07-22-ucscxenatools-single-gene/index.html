<p>When using <code>UCSCXenaTools</code> package, you may want to focus on single gene analysis, a typical case has been shown in my previous blog <a href="https://shixiangwang.github.io/home/en/post/ucscxenatools-201908/">UCSCXenaTools: Retrieve Gene Expression and Clinical Information from UCSC Xena for Survival Analysis</a>. Here I will describe how to get single gene values (especially RNAseq data) in details.</p>
<p>Let’s load package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(UCSCXenaTools)
#&gt; =========================================================================================
#&gt; UCSCXenaTools version 1.3.3

<h2>First, Find Your Interest Dataset</h2>
<p>UCSC Xena provides more than 1000 datasets, when you want to get values for single gene, you must select a target dataset. You can find them in the following table or from <a href="https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/">UCSC Xena datasets page</a>.</p>

<p>Pick up a dataset and get its <code>XenaHosts</code> and <code>XenaDatasets</code>, i.e. get its data hub host URL and dataset ID. You can copy them or you can use your R skill to get and store them in a object. For example, I got a reader want to study RNASeq values of TCGA LUAD gene.</p>

<h2>Get Your Gene Values</h2>
<p>Once you got dataset information, you can get a specific gene expression (it also works for gene-level CNV, mutation, etc based on your dataset) by <code>fetch_dense_values</code>. Run <code>?fetch</code> in your R console to see more details.</p>
<p>For example, I will query the gene <code>TP53</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TP53 &lt;- fetch_dense_values(
  host = ge$XenaHosts, # You can also set &quot;https://tcga.xenahubs.net&quot;
  dataset = ge$XenaDatasets, # You can also set &quot;TCGA.LUAD.sampleMap/HiSeqV2&quot;
  identifiers = &quot;TP53&quot;,
  use_probeMap = TRUE
) %&gt;%
  .[1, ]
#&gt; -&gt; Checking identifiers...
#&gt; -&gt; use_probeMap is TRUE, skipping checking identifiers...
#&gt; -&gt; Done.
#&gt; -&gt; Checking samples...
#&gt; -&gt; Done.
#&gt; -&gt; Checking if the dataset has probeMap...
#&gt; -&gt; Done. ProbeMap is found.
head(TP53)
#&gt; TCGA-69-7978-01 TCGA-62-8399-01 TCGA-78-7539-01 TCGA-50-5931-11 TCGA-73-4658-01 
#&gt;            9.89            8.31           10.35            9.62           10.02 
#&gt; TCGA-44-6775-01 
#&gt;           10.16</code></pre>
<p>Typically, the TCGA sample ID have 15 letters, and the 14-15th letters mark a sample type. When it <code>&lt;10</code>, it is a tumor sample, otherwise it is a normal sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(as.integer(substr(names(TP53), 14, 15)))
#&gt;

#&gt; 515   2  59</code></pre>
<p>Now you can start your analysis with this data.</p>

<h2>Other Things May Help</h2>
<p>In addition to <code>fetch_*</code> functions, I generated many low-level API functions for UCSC Xena database, which described at <a href="https://shixiangwang.github.io/home/en/tools/ucscxenatools-api/" class="uri">https://shixiangwang.github.io/home/en/tools/ucscxenatools-api/</a>. These functions can access different levels of data information in UCSC Xena. Some of them are combined to construct the core functionalities provided by <code>UCSCXenaTools</code> for now.</p>
<p>NOTE: not API functions work well, I haven’t tested them all, they are all generated by dynamic code based on <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/UCSCXenaTools/tree/master/inst/queries">XQuery</a>.</p>
<p>An R Shiny package <a href="https://github.com/openbiox/UCSCXenaShiny/">UCSCXenaShiny</a> provides a web-based platform to download datasets and analyze single genes. Besides, we have constructed some functions to get pan-cancer level single gene expression, CNV and mutation etc.</p>
<p>You can download recent development version in GitHub with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;openbiox/XenaShiny&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>After you load this package, you can use the following functions to get data easily.</p>
<pre><code>get_ccle_cn_value: Fetch copy number value from CCLE dataset

get_ccle_gene_value: Fetch gene expression value from CCLE dataset

get_ccle_protein_value: Fetch gene protein expression value from CCLE dataset

get_ccle_mutation_status: Fetch gene mutation info from CCLE dataset

get_pancan_value: Fetch identifier value from pan-cancer dataset

get_pancan_gene_value: Fetch gene expression value from pan-cancer dataset

get_pancan_protein_value: Fetch protein expression value from pan-cancer dataset

get_pancan_mutation_status: Fetch mutation status value from pan-cancer dataset

get_pancan_cn_value: Fetch gene copy number value from pan-cancer dataset processed by GISTIC 2.0</code></pre>
