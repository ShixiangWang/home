A few days ago, I asked Tyler about how did he create the logo of R package [exoplanets](https://github.com/tyluRp/exoplanets). 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="logo of R package exoplanets", out.width = "200px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyluRp/exoplanets/master/man/figures/logo.png")
```

I really love this logo because it is very simple and elegant.

He told me he used a software called **omnigraffle** to make the logos. I tried learning this software and still did not know how to use it to create a nice logo because I am not good at creating beautiful things.

I gave up trying and returned back to use R package **hexSticker**. I used it before to create the first logo 
for **UCSCXenaTools**. Last time I used a figure from web to create logo, the result logo is okay but I think it's a little ugly. 

This time I want to try something new. I am not good at drawing, after a few minutes of thinking, 
I decided to draw a plot which can represent the datasets information of **UCSC Xena database**. 
R package **ggpubr** based on **ggplot2** is a good tool for doing this.  

First, I loaded all necessary packages.

```{r}
library(hexSticker)
library(UCSCXenaTools)
library(dplyr)
library(ggpubr)
```

Then I calculated dataset counts in each **UCSC Xena Hubs**.

```{r}
df =  XenaData %>%
    dplyr::group_by(XenaHostNames) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(count = n())
```

Next I drawed a blank dotchart according to reference of **ggpubr** and README of **hexSticker**.

```{r}
# reference https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/
p <- ggdotchart(df, x = "XenaHostNames", y = "count",
           color = "XenaHostNames",
           palette = "jco",
           sorting = "descending",                       # Sort value in descending order
           add = "segments",                             # Add segments from y = 0 to dots
           rotate = TRUE,                                # Rotate vertically
           dot.size = 2,                                 # Large dot size
           label = round(df$count),                        # Add mpg values as dot labels
           font.label = list(color = "white", size = 2,
                             vjust = 0.5),               # Adjust label parameters
           ggtheme = theme_void()) +                       # ggplot2 theme
    theme_transparent() + theme(legend.position = "none") 
p
```

At the end, I created the logo with `sticker()` function. 
I tried modifying options several times to make all parts in the logo work well.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sticker(p, package="UCSCXenaTools", p_size=4.5, s_x=0.9, s_y=1, s_width=1.7, s_height=1.3,
        p_x = 1.1, p_y = 0.9,
        url = "https://cran.r-project.org/package=UCSCXenaTools", u_color = "white", u_size = 1,
        h_fill="black", h_color="grey",
        filename="man/figures/logo.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="logo of R package UCSCXenaTools", out.width = "200px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShixiangWang/UCSCXenaTools/master/man/figures/logo.png")
```

I think it is not bad, right?

***

Thanks all authors of the packages I mentioned at above.
